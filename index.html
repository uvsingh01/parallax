        <h2>About</h2>
        <p class="cont">Apex Legends is a free-to-play battle royale-hero shooter game developed by Respawn Entertainment and published by Electronic Arts. 
            It was released for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4, and Xbox One in February 2019, for Nintendo Switch in March 2021, 
            and for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S in March 2022.Apex Legends is set in the same science fiction universe
            as Respawn Entertainment's Titanfall series, with several characters from the Titanfall series appearing either
            as minor characters or playable Legends. Work on the game began around late 2016, though the project remained
            a secret right up until its launch. The game's release in 2019 came as a surprise, as until that point it 
            had been assumed that Respawn Entertainment was working on a third installment to the Titanfall franchise, 
            the studio's previous major game. Apex Legends received generally positive reviews from critics, who praised
            its gameplay, progression system, and fusion of elements from various genres. Some considered it a worthy 
            competitor to other battle royale games. Apex Legends surpassed 25 million players by the end of its first 
            week, and 50 million within its first month. By April 2021, it had approximately 
            100 million players making it one of the most played video games of all time by player count.

                and a dozen other things depending on who’s doing the whispering.

                    this is taking place, so don't try to be Rambo and go full bore at your enemies. However, due to your speed of movement, 
                    you can flank quite effectively. You scan 20% faster than normal and can scan every 8 seconds while in beast of the hunt.
                    Beast of the Hunt lasts for 35 seconds, but when under 15 seconds, any knockdowns - Yes, knockdowns, 
                    not kills will send the timer back to 15, meaning you can gain up to 14 seconds of extra Hunt time after every knockdown.
